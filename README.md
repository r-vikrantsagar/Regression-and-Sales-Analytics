# Regression and Sales Analytics

This project applies regression modeling techniques to analyze and predict sales trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for forecasting and performance evaluation.

## Problem Statement

Accurate sales forecasting is essential for budgeting, inventory management, and marketing. This project aims to develop regression-based models to predict sales and evaluate key drivers impacting business performance.

## Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned and prepared sales datasets for modeling.
  - Engineered relevant features such as month, discount rate, unit cost, and customer region.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Analyzed sales trends over time and by product category.
  - Visualized key patterns using histograms, line plots, and heatmaps.

- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - Implemented multiple regression models including:
    - Linear Regression
    - Ridge Regression
    - Lasso Regression
  - Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.

## Solution

Developed interpretable models to forecast future sales and understand the impact of pricing, discounts, and seasonal effects. The models provide quantitative insights to guide marketing strategies and resource allocation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Learnings

- Regularization techniques help reduce overfitting in linear models.
- Visual exploration complements statistical analysis for identifying trends.
- Feature selection plays a critical role in improving model performance.

## Future Work

- Extend to time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
- Incorporate external data such as holidays, economic indicators, or weather.
- Automate reporting and model updates through scheduled pipelines.
